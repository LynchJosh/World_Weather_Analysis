# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project contains 3 folders that demonstrate 3 different types of API integration in projects. I used Open Weather, Google Directions API, and Google Maps API. Open Weather and  Google Maps were used to gather temperature data and markers for hotels based on user temperature preferences. Google Directions API was used to create a travel itinerary between different cities with markers and hotels.
